1 ToDate(milliseconds)
This function returns a date-time object according to the given parameters. The other alternative for this function are ToDate(iosstring), ToDate(userstring, format), ToDate(userstring, format, timezone)

todate_data = foreach date_data generate ToDate(date,'yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss')
   as (date_time:DateTime >);

---------------------------------
2	CurrentTime()
returns the date-time object of the current time.
currenttime_data = foreach todate_data generate CurrentTime();
---------------------------------
3	GetDay(datetime)
Returns the day of a month from the date-time object.
getday_data = foreach todate_data generate(date_time), GetDay(date_time);
---------------------------------
4	GetHour(datetime)
Returns the hour of a day from the date-time object.
gethour_data = foreach todate_data generate (date_time), GetHour(date_time);
5	GetMilliSecond(datetime)
Returns the millisecond of a second from the date-time object.

6	GetMinute(datetime)
Returns the minute of an hour from the date-time object.

7	GetMonth(datetime)
Returns the month of a year from the date-time object.

8	GetSecond(datetime)
Returns the second of a minute from the date-time object.

9	GetWeek(datetime)
Returns the week of a year from the date-time object.

10	GetWeekYear(datetime)
Returns the week year from the date-time object.

11	GetYear(datetime)
Returns the year from the date-time object.
---------------------------------------------------


12	AddDuration(datetime, duration)
Returns the result of a date-time object along with the duration object.

Note − The Duration is represented in ISO 8601 standard. According to ISO 8601 standard P is placed at the beginning, while representing the duration and it is called as duration designator. Likewise,

Y is the year designator. We use this after declaring the year.

Example − P1Y represents 1 year.

M is the month designator. We use this after declaring the month.

Example − P1M represents 1 month.

W is the week designator. We use this after declaring the week.

Example − P1W represents 1 week.

D is the day designator. We use this after declaring the day.

Example − P1D represents 1 day.

T is the time designator. We use this before declaring the time.

Example − PT5H represents 5 hours.

H is the hour designator. We use this after declaring the hour.

Example − PT1H represents 1 hour.

M is the minute designator. We use this after declaring the minute.

Example − PT1M represents 1 minute.

S is the second designator. We use this after declaring the second.

Example − PT1S represents 1 second.
